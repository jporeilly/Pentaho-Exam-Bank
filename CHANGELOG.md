# Changelog

All notable changes to Pentaho Question Bank are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-21

The first tracked version. The code predates it — what is new here is the
Pentaho name, a package that no longer depends on the folder it sits in, and an
import path that can read a live course exam without quietly damaging it.

### Added

- **`scripts/migrate_pcm_exams.py`** — adopts a PCM course's exam into the
  bank. One certification per course, ids preserved, and it verifies the ids
  survived rather than assuming it. The course slug is resolved at run time and
  must exist: a cached slug that silently stopped resolving is how the bank's
  two original certifications died when PCM renamed the courses under them.

- **`pool_order`** on a question — the position it held in its course pool,
  added through the existing schema-migration path. `-1` means it was not
  adopted from a pool.

- **`tests/test_pcm_roundtrip.py`** — nine tests guarding the round-trip, plus
  `VERSION.md`, `INSTALL.md`, this file, and a version-drift test.

### Fixed

- **Question ids are preserved when adopting a course exam.** They were
  discarded, so every question got a fresh uuid on import. The live pools use
  hand-authored ids (`m1-q1`, `q-preview`), and PCM treats an id as a durable
  external key — it goes into the results payload posted to the webhook, and an
  in-progress attempt is keyed on the ids it was dealt. Minting would have
  orphaned every recorded result. A question genuinely without an id still gets
  one; PCM's own fallback for that case is positional (`q1`, `q2`, …), which
  must never be relied on.

- **The `source` citation survives a round-trip.** It is richer than `module` —
  "Lab 1 — Your First Win" against "See It Work" — and the exporter rebuilt it
  from `topic`, downgrading it to the bare module name every time. An authored
  citation now wins; a generated question still gets one built from course plus
  section.

- **A pool keeps its authored order.** Nothing recorded it, and `search()`
  returns `updated_at DESC`, so writing a pool back reordered the entire
  `questions` array. That is an unreadable diff, and in a pool that draws N
  questions with shuffle off it silently changes which questions get asked.

  Verified against the live files: `pdi-2hr-lab` (20 questions) and
  `developer-di-practitioner` (48) both round-trip byte-identically, in order.

### Changed

- **Renamed to Pentaho Question Bank**, matching the other Pentaho repos — on
  disk and on GitHub (`jporeilly/Pentaho-Question-Bank`).

- **The Python package moved into `question_bank/`.** The repo directory *was*
  the package: a root `__init__.py`, and tests importing `question_bank.core.*`.
  That made `C:\Projects` itself a source root, and made the folder name
  load-bearing — the rename would have broken every import, because a hyphen is
  not valid in a Python identifier. The repo root is now the source root.

- **The project root is derived once.** Four modules each walked
  `parent.parent[.parent]` to find it, and all four shifted a level in the move;
  they now import `PROJECT_ROOT` / `ASSETS_DIR` from `utils.config`.

### Known limitations

- **Nothing publishes back to a course yet.** `export_pcm_exam_json` writes a
  fresh `exam.json` from a fixed parameter list and has no parameter for
  `intake`, so publishing would delete the pre-exam candidate form config that
  the Content Editor owns. The publish step must merge into the existing file —
  the mirror of the editor's `put_exam`. See `PLAN.md` §3.4.

- PPTX and vision-model generation still work but are slated to be dropped in
  0.2.0; the future of this app is course content.
