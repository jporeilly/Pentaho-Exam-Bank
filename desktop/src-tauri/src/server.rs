// Lifecycle of the bundled Python backend.
//
// The app is a FastAPI server serving a React SPA, so the desktop build has to
// run a real HTTP server and point a webview at it. Three things make that
// safe enough to hand to someone else's laptop:
//
//   1. A FREE PORT, chosen at launch. 7788 is the app's usual port and a
//      second instance - or anything else on the machine - must not turn into
//      "the app won't start".
//   2. A JOB OBJECT on Windows, so the server dies when we do, INCLUDING when
//      we are killed from Task Manager or crash. A leaked uvicorn keeps its
//      port and its lock on the SQLite database, and the next launch then
//      fails for a reason the user cannot see.
//   3. NO STATE UNDER THE INSTALL. utils/config.py creates its database and
//      config directories at import, off the package root - which under
//      Program Files raises PermissionError before the app can say anything.
//      PEB_STATE_DIR, set below, moves all of it to the per-user directory.
//
// Adapted from the Content Editor's shell, which is where most of these
// lessons were paid for.
